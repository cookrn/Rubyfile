# Rubyfile

A `Rubyfile` is for you, the developer.

## What's In It

To start, the version denominator for the ruby interpreter
you expect your code to run on.

See the example `Rubyfile`

## What Do You Do With It

For now, just give it a hug. Maybe, if you're feeling lucky, make sure
it is in all of your ruby projects and contains the appropriate ruby
version information.

## Goals

Ideally, there would be a structured format to specify all the necessary
information to appropriately compile a custom ruby local to the project.

This would require:

* A format definition: use YAML or JSON?
* An `sh` script to read the file and download/compile a ruby local to
  the project.
